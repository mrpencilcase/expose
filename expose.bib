	abstract = {We report on first-principles study of uniaxial strength for brittle cleavage of AlN/VN, AlN/TiN and VN/TiN systems. In agreement with previous studies we predict that the VN/TiN exhibits interface induced toughening of VN as compared to bulk values, and a similar effect is predicted also to occur in the VN/AlN system. However, a more detailed insight reveals, that the theoretical critical stress for brittle cleavage largely oscillates (even below the critical stress for bulk) with the distance from the interface inside the VN layer, a phenomenon not present (or hugely reduced) in TiN and AlN layers. The oscillating values for critical stress well correlate with the same behavior of interplanar distances and charge density. The origin of these unexpected properties was pinpointed to structural instabilities of cubic VN.},

	abstract = {Coherently grown nanolayered TiN/CrN thin films exhibit a superlattice effect in fracture toughness, similar to the reported effect in indentation hardness. We found –by employing in-situ micromechanical cantilever bending tests on free-standing TiN/CrN superlattice films– that the fracture toughness increases with decreasing bilayer period ($\Lambda$), reaching a maximum at $\Lambda$ {\~{}} 6 nm. For ultrathin layers ($\Lambda$ {\~{}} 2 nm), the fracture toughness drops to the lowest values due to intermixing and loss of superlattice structure. Both, fracture toughness and hardness peak for similar bilayer periods of TiN/CrN superlattices.},

@article{Yu2010,
	abstract = {We present an efficient method to obtain single-crystal elastic constants. Using the method, the computation effort for the complete set of elastic constants (21 components for a triclinic crystal) of a crystal under a given strain state is similar to that for the bulk modulus, where the latter is normally calculated first together with the equilibrium volume by fitting the volume-dependent energy to an equation of state. The idea in the efficiency improvement is to apply linear-independent coupling strains to a crystal, and to extract the complete set of elastic constants simultaneously. For the new method, a single set of strains are universally applicable to all crystals, and less number of strains are needed for crystals of higher symmetry. Calculated single-crystal elastic constants of cubic diamond, hexagonal osmium, orthorhombic TiSi2 and monoclinic Mg5Si6 are given as examples. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
